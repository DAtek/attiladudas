Testing interactions with the database isn't the easiest. Doing it properly can be even challenging.  
This post presents a practice which helps testing the database efficiently.

## Types of tests

Based on how much code is being tested in a test case, the following test categories can be defined:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End to end tests (E2E)

<br />

**Unit tests** are testing a single unit of code, separated from all external resources. These are the **simplest, fastest, cheapest** tests.

<br />

**Integration tests** are testing that a unit of code can be integrated with another unit of code or with an external resource.
These tests are **more complicated, slower, more expensive**.

<br />

**E2E tests** are testing that a system behaves correctly. These are the **most complicated, slowest, most expensive** tests.

## Why unit tests aren't suitable for the purpose

You may think, OK, if unit tests are the fastest simplest, and cheapest, why don't we write only unit tests?

<br />

The answer is: there are things which can't be tested with unit tests, and database interactions fall into this category.

<br />

If you wrote unit tests for the code interacting with your database, you would have to mock out the actual interactions,
so the tests would lose their original purpose.

<br />

Altough if you asked the above question, you were right, one should write unit tests as long as possible.
If something can't be tested with a unit test, try testing it with an integration test. If it can't be tested with integration test, then write an E2E test
\- this explains the shape of the testing pyramid.  
Keep you test suite [simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), just like everything else.

## Testing with integrations tests

The following demonstration is written in [`Go`](https://go.dev/), but the same setup can be achieved with probably all languages.

<br />
In this case I'm using the [gorm](https://gorm.io/) library, because I don't
like to deal with low-level database libraries. Let these higher level libraries
do the connection-pooling and constructing the `SQL` statements. If you don't
trust the authors, you can implement these functionalities and re-invent the
wheel.

<br />

Let's consider having a very simple module responsible for creating and deleting users:

```go
package db_test

import (
	"db_test/db"
	"errors"

	"gorm.io/gorm"
)

func CreateUser(conn *gorm.DB, name string) (db.User, error) {
	user := db.User{Name: name}
	res := conn.Create(&user)
	return user, res.Error
}

func DeleteUser(conn *gorm.DB, id int) error {
	res := conn.Where("id = ?", id).Delete(&db.User{})

	if res.Error != nil {
		return res.Error
	}

	if res.RowsAffected == 0 {
		return errors.New("USER_NOT_EXISTS")
	}

	return nil
}
```

Both functions are receiving the `conn` argument, which is the database _connection_, and as you will see this is essential from the testing perspective.
Maybe a later post will cover the importance of [DI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection).

<br />

Since `gorm` doesn't have different types for connections and transactions, the `conn` parameter could be either.
Let's gather the pros and cons using a connection or a transaction in the functions.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>Cons</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Connection</strong>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We can be sure the data is being saved into the db (commit can happen within the function)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Tests can affect eachother</li>
        <li>Tests can't run in parallel</li>
        <li>Tests are slower compared to the transactional tests</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Transaction</strong>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>The commit can be executed in a single, centralised function</li>
        <li>Tests can't affect eachother (transactional isolation)</li>
        <li>
          Rolling back at the end of each test is faster than commiting and
          deleting
        </li>
        <li>Tests can run in parallel</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We can't be sure the data is being saved into the db, additional test
          is needed
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br />

Now it's clearly visible: we should pass transactions to our functions and not the connection itself.  
Let's have a look at the tests:

```go
package db_test

import (
	"db_test/db"
	"testing"

	"github.com/DAtek/gotils"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"

	"gorm.io/gorm"
)

func TestCreateUser(t *testing.T) {
	t.Run(
		"Creates user",
		db.TestWithTransaction(func(t *testing.T, tx *gorm.DB) {
			// given
			name := "Asimov"

			// when
			user := gotils.ResultOrPanic(CreateUser(tx, name))

			// then
			assert.Equal(t, name, user.Name)
			savedUser := db.User{}
			tx.Find(&savedUser).Where("id = ?", user.Id)
			assert.Equal(t, name, savedUser.Name)
		}))

	t.Run(
		"Returns error if user with the same name already exists",
		db.TestWithTransaction(func(t *testing.T, tx *gorm.DB) {
			// given
			name := "Asimov"
			CreateUser(tx, name)

			// when
			_, err := CreateUser(tx, name)

			// then
			assert.Error(t, err)
		}))
}

func TestDeleteUser(t *testing.T) {
	t.Run(
		"Deletes user",
		db.TestWithTransaction(func(t *testing.T, tx *gorm.DB) {
			// given
			user := db.User{Name: "Isaac"}
			res := tx.Create(&user)
			if res.Error != nil {
				panic(res.Error)
			}

			// when
			err := DeleteUser(tx, user.Id)

			// then
			assert.Nil(t, err)
			count := int64(0)
			tx.Find(&db.User{}).Where("id = ?", user.Id).Count(&count)
			assert.Equal(t, int64(0), count)
		}))

	t.Run(
		"Returns error if user not exists",
		db.TestWithTransaction(func(t *testing.T, tx *gorm.DB) {
			// when
			err := DeleteUser(tx, 1)

			// then
			assert.Error(t, err)
		}))

	t.Run(
		"Returns error if unexpected event happens",
		db.TestWithTransaction(func(t *testing.T, tx *gorm.DB) {
			// given
			user := db.User{Name: "Isaac"}
			res := tx.Create(&user)
			if res.Error != nil {
				panic(res.Error)
			}

			tx.Rollback()

			// when
			err := DeleteUser(tx, user.Id)

			// then
			assert.Error(t, err)
		}))
}
```

<br />

And the `test_helpers.go`:

```go
package db

import (
	"sync"
	"testing"

	"github.com/DAtek/gotils"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
)

var GetTestConn = sync.OnceValue(func() *gorm.DB {
	return gotils.ResultOrPanic(NewConnFromEnv())
})

func GetTestTransaction() *gorm.DB {
	return GetTestConn().Begin()
}

func TestWithTransaction(
	transactionalTest func(t *testing.T, tx *gorm.DB),
) func(t *testing.T) {
	return func(t *testing.T) {
		tx := GetTestTransaction()
		t.Cleanup(func() { tx.Rollback() })
		transactionalTest(t, tx)
	}
}


```

With this approach each test owns a transaction and the test suite can stay blazingly fast.
