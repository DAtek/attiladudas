## The simplest thing on Earth: Sour dough!

I'm not joking, it's really simple.
To make sour dough you only need 2 ingredients: flour and water.
Mix them together in a ~450 ml glass jar (the ratio is almost 1:1, use a little bit less water if it's too dilute) and wait until it starts to bubble. This usually takes a week. If it's colder, it can take more time, if it's hotter, then less. You don't have to worry about the temperature, in 15˚C - 30˚C range it'll work, but probably would work out of this temperature range too.
Start with mixing 200g flour and 200g water, and feed it every day an extra spoon flour and water. Always use whole grain flour, which provides the necessary minerals to the bacteria and fungi.

If you see bubbles, it's ready. You can put it in the fridge and take out when needed.

## Making the bread

12 hours before you mix up your bread dough, take out the sour dough from the fridge.
Calculate how much sour dough will you require for the bread and mix the required amount to your sour dough, then let it rest on room temperature to let the bacteria populate.

After that, it should be full of bubbles. Now mix together your bread, leave it resting for another 12 hours, then you can bake it.
