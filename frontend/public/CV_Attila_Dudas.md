# Introduction

Working as a fullstack developer since 2018, but mostly focused on backend.  

I always put big effort in writing Clean Code and achieving 95%+ test coverage. I’ve learned a lot from my and other developers’ mistakes, so now I’m
confident that I know how to build maintainable, stable, performant software.
